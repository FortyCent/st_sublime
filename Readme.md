# IEC Structured Text support for Sublime Text 3

It is not. I just added some stuff to a standard Pascal package.
Why? Because some ST (or whatever it is called by manufacturer) editors built in <b>Ultimate, Best, Development Environments for Industrial Automation</b> are so unbearably fierce that it is literally better to copy all text into ordinary notepad and use it for development. It is 21st century and I'm tired of editor which autocompletion function destroys my code and which syntax highlighting feature slows it down to unspeakable level.

So this package modification is born from unimaginable anger. Please don't expect it to be perfect. If you can do better, go for it.

## Installation

Just clone this repository and move it into standard packeges directory.

```
cd C:\Users\__your user name__\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\
git clone https://github.com/mszubart/IEC_ST.sublimePackage.git
```
